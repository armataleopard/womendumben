            <p>The first meme coin celebrating blonde chaos, beauty disasters, and financial decisions based on vibes only. Because being dumb isn't a disadvantageâ€”it's an identity.</p>

                    <p>I bought $hahwomen after my friend told me it's like, totally the vibe. I didn't really understand what a wallet was, so I just clicked buttons until I saw confetti. Two days later, I was down 80% but I felt empowered. Because being dumb isn't a disadvantage. It's an identity. Haters will never get it. I hold with confidence and no plan whatsoever. I just know that if it looks pink and sparkly, it's gonna the moon. Right?</p>

                    <p>My journey with $hahwomen started after I accidentally sold my rent money for dog pictures. I didn't cry. I reinvested. Now I'm a proud holder of 1.2M $hahwomen and I still don't know how DeFi works. One time I tried to stake it on a hair tutorial site. But the vibes were immaculate. I've made zero gains, but I gained self-love. Which is the real alpha. Not financial advice. Just blonde math.</p>
